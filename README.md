# sync_folder
 A program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program maintains a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder.
 
 To use this program, you can save the code to a file (e.g., sync.py) and run it from the command line as follows:
python sync.py /path/to/source/folder /path/to/replica/folder interval /path/to/log/file.log

Replace /path/to/source/folder with the path to the source folder, /path/to/replica/folder with the path

eg: python sync.py C:\Test\source_folder C:\Test\replica_folder 2 C:\Test\file.log
